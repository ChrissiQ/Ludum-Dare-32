# I Am Plant
My entry for Ludum Dare 32.  VERY UNFINISHED.  I would not bother playing this if I were you!!  Seriously, it's not any fun.

In 'I Am Plant', you play as a plant.  Your goals are pretty much those of any other plant on earth - grow, don't get eaten, and reproduce.

Animals are crawling around looking for a nice bite of greens.  Many of them will want to eat you.  You will have to react quickly and use your powers to avoid being eaten!

This game is currently in a bad state - interactivity is not implemented.  This game is not fun - I repeat, THIS GAME IS NOT FUN, so don't blame me for wasting your time if you choose to play it!  I wouldn't recommend it.

## How to play

This game runs under Unity 5.0.  You can [download](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=42789) the compiled version from the LD32 site.
